### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my page. Here is brief overview of who I am and what I do:
- I am a teacher  by nature. I was a lecturer before becoming a Full Stack Developer.
- I have always loved computing and video games, so naturally I drifted towards coding in University.
- I did not start coding until 2017 when I got my first laptop as a coding instructor.
- I believe in the Zen of Python.
- I think Nest.js is a freaking great framework. While Node.js is good and allows freedom, I prefer the regiment and structure of Nest.js. Perhaps because I am an old school developer and I am used to following rules and thinking in a synchronous fashion. Perhaps my time with Django also contributed to it.
- I am a jack of all languages but master of two: **Python** and **JavaScript**. Special mention goes to my first ever programming language: **C++**.
- I love hosting my projects on either Hostinger, AWS or Digital Ocean. Firebase works excellently for React projects I want to showcase.
- I also believe every developer should use Docusaurus. It makes Documentation so easy.
